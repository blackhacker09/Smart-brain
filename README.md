## Tech Stack :

* **Client:** React JS

* **Server:** Node JS, Express JS

* **Database:** PostgreSQL

* **API** Clarifai API

## How does it work?

* Design a user interface for the web application, including a sign-in/register form and a form to enter the image URL.
* Implement the user authentication system, allowing users to sign in or register for an account. You can use a user management framework or build the authentication system yourself.
* Once the user is authenticated, direct them to the home page.
* On the home page, provide an input field where users can enter the URL of an image.
* When the user clicks the "Detect" button, the web application should fetch the image using the provided URL.
* Use a face detection algorithm or a pre-trained machine learning model to analyze the image and detect faces.
* Count the number of detected faces and store this information in a database or session variable, associated with the user's account.
* Display the detected faces count to the user on the home page or in a separate results page.
* After the user has clicked detect the webapp fetchs the image and detects faces from it and the count of your detecting faces is always remembered.
